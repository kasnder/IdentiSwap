# IdentiSwap
Learn about the filter bubble - Explore what others see on popular online platforms!

## Overview

This project provides a browser extension, suitable for Firefox, Chrome, and Edge. Currently, only the streaming platform YouTube is supported, where the usual video recommendations are complemented by **unpersonalised** recommendations, that a first-time visitor would see.

## Settings

On the **settings page** of the extension, a maximum number of additional results can be chosen as you like!

## Motivation

This is a research project into the functioning of personalised online platforms so as to demonstrate the **bias** that may be experienced.

## Technical realisation

When accessing a YouTube video page, the extension requests additional video recommendations from YouTube without sending the usual identifiers, such as cookies. These are then displayed seamlessly alongside the usual recommendations. During this process, the IP address of the user is not obfuscated, to allow for localisation of the recommendations and avoid ending up with recommendations in a foreign language.
