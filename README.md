# IdentiSwap - See what others see!

This project provides a browser extension to expose the bias of YouTube's up-next recommendations.
This tool complements the usual video recommendations with those a first-time visitor would see.

## Setup

To install this browser extension, just download it from the respective extension store:
- [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/de/firefox/addon/identiswap/)
- [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/identiswap/lnpjldfnkifjhcnoiaomcgibphilpcha)

## Technicalities

When accessing a YouTube video page, the extension requests additional video recommendations from YouTube without sending the usual identifiers, such as cookies. These are then displayed seamlessly alongside the usual recommendations. 
Please note that platform provide may still use other means of identification, such as browser properties and the IP address.
