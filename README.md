# IdentiSwap
Learn about the filter bubble - Explore what others see on popular online platforms!

## Overview

This project provides a browser extension, suitable for Firefox, Chrome, and Edge. Currently, only the streaming platform YouTube is supported, where the suggestions are complemented by **unpersonalised** video suggestions, thus video suggestions a first-time visitor at YouTube would see.

## Settings

On the **settings page** of the extension, a maximum number of additional results can be chosen as you like!

## Motivation

This is a research project into the functioning of personalised online platforms so as to demonstrate the **bias** that may be experienced.

## Technology used

Under the hood, the extension sends an additional request to the currently browsed video page without any identifier, such as cookies, and incorporates the gathered results into the YouTube video page.

## Rights

This product has not been endorsed or certified by the YouTube, LLC. All rights regarding the name and brand YouTube belong to their owners. This project is solely for research purposes without any commercial affiliation.
